= Acts As Rateble

Acts_as_rateable is a rails plugin providing a rating interface for ActiveRecord models. 
It is released under the MIT license. 
The original plugin is used on cotcot.hu for article rating, sponsored quizzes, etc.

= Features

* Rating scores are recorded by user
* Users can update previous ratings
* Uses a polymorphic association to your model, so no changes to your existing models in the database are required
* Stores computed score and number of ratings for efficient data access
* Possibility to change range of the ratings (1..5 is default)

= Installation

== Install as gem (recommended)

Install as a gem:

    $ sudo gem install mreinsch-acts_as_rateable

Then add the gem dependency in your config:

    # config/environment.rb
    config.gem "mreinsch-acts_as_rateable", :source => "http://gems.github.com", :lib => "acts_as_rateable"

== Install as plugin

To install as a plugin, use:

    $ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/mreinsch/acts_as_rateable.git

= Example Usage

Install the plugin into your vendor/plugins directory, insert 'acts_as_rateable' into your model, then restart your application.

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_rateable
    end

Now your model is extended by the plugin, you can rate it (1-#) or calculate the average rating.

    @post.rate_it(4, current_user)

    @post.average_rating          #=> 4.0
    @post.average_rating_round    #=> 4
    @post.average_rating_percent  #=> 80
    @post.rated_by?(current_user) #=> true
    @post.rating_by(current_user) #=> 4
    @post.ratings_couunt          #=> 1

    Post.find_top_rated           #=> top rated records

Optional you can specify the highest score using the :max_rating paramter as follows. The default for :max_rating is 5.

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_rateable :max_rating => 10
    end

See acts_as_rateable.rb for further details!
